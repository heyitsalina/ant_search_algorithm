Welcome to our Ant-Simulation-Project. Here you can learn more about ants and how they find food. We give you a easy-to-follow instruction on how to run a simulation yourself.

## Installation

1. Firstly, you need to clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heyitsalina/ant_search_algorithm.git
```

2. Secondly navigate to the Project directory

```bash
cd ant_search_algorithm/
```

3. Thirdly, you need to install the dependencies

```bash
pip install .
```

## Run Locally

Run the simulation from the Project directory

```bash
python resouces/gui.py
```

## Demo

If you started the Simulation there should be a GUI like this.

LINK TO PICTURE

You can place the Food and the Ant-Colonies on the map by clicking the food/colony and placing it at the desired location.
Double Clicking the placed Food or Colony Object you get additional Parameters to change. Explore :)

With Start you can Run the simulation and Stop it. If you had enough you can delete you current simulation on clear.

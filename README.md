Welcome to our Ant-Simulation-Project, an interactive simulation of an ants food search. This project uses algorithms to simulate how ants find food and navigate through their environment. Whether you're a biology enthusiast, an educator, or just curious, our easy-to-follow instructions will help you run your own simulations and discover the intricacies of ant behavior.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heyitsalina/ant_search_algorithm.git
```

2. Navigate to the Project directory

```bash
cd ant_search_algorithm/
```

3. Install the dependencies

```bash
pip install .
```

## Run Locally

To run the simulation from the Project directory, execute:

```bash
python resouces/gui.py
```

## Demo

If you started the Simulation the GUI should look like this

- **Interactivity:** Place food and ant colonies on the map with simple clicks, and adjust their parameters with a double-click to tailor the simulation to your curiosity. Explore :)
- **Control:** Use the **start** and **stop** buttons to run and stop the simulation.
- **Reset:** Clear your current simulation with the **Clear** button to start fresh anytime.

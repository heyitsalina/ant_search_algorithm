## Installation
1. Firstly, you need to clone this repository

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/heyitsalina/ant_search_algorithm.git
```

2. Secondly navigate to the Project directory


```bash
cd ant_search_algorithm/
```

3. Thirdly, you need to install the dependencies

```bash
pip install .
```
## Run Locally

Run the simulation from the Project directory

```bash
python resouces/gui.py
```




## Demo

If you started the Simulation there should be a GUI like this.

LINK TO PICTURE

You can place the Food and the Ant-Colonies on the map by clicking the food/colony and placing it at the desired location. 
Double Clicking the placed Food or Colony Object you get additional Parameters to change. Explore :)

With Start you can Run the simulation and Stop it. If you had enough you can delete you current simulation on clear.

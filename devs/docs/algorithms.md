# Algorithms Used in Ant Food Search Simulation

## Overview

This document outlines the algorithms and decision-making processes employed in the Ant Food Search Simulation. It focuses on how ants find food, navigate using pheromones, interact with food sources, and manage colony resources.

## Ant Movement and Decision Making

Ants decide their movement based on a combination of random exploration and pheromone trail following. The movement is influenced by several factors including the presence of pheromones, obstacles, and the ant's current state (searching for food or returning to the colony).

### Key Processes:

- **Initial Direction**: At the start, ants move in a randomly chosen direction.
- **Pheromone Influence**: Ants adjust their path based on pheromone concentrations, favoring directions with higher pheromone levels.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Ants detect and navigate around obstacles encountered during their search.
- **Food Detection and Collection**: Upon locating food, ants collect it and switch their status to return to the colony, leaving a pheromone trail.

## Pheromone Management

Pheromones are crucial for indirect communication between ants. They leave pheromone trails to guide other ants to food sources and back to the colony.

### Key Processes:

- **Pheromone Deposition**: Ants deposit pheromones along their path as they move.
- **Pheromone Evaporation**: Over time, pheromone intensity decreases, simulating natural evaporation.
- **Trail Following**: Ants sense and follow pheromone trails to find food sources or return to the colony.

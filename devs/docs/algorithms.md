# Algorithms Used in Ant Food Search Simulation

## Overview

This document outlines the algorithms and decision-making processes employed in the Ant Food Search Simulation. It focuses on how ants find food, navigate using pheromones, interact with food sources, and manage colony resources.

## Ant Movement and Decision Making

Ants decide their movement based on a combination of random exploration and pheromone trail following. The movement is influenced by several factors including the presence of pheromones, obstacles, and the ant's current state (searching for food or returning to the colony).

### Key Processes:

- **Initial Direction**: At the start, ants move in a randomly chosen direction until some ants find food. They do this this by generating a random angle theta and using it to create a normalized direction vector scaled by self.step_size. On subsequent moves, it randomly adjusts this direction within a specific angle range (angle_offset), applies this rotation to maintain or change its trajectory, and recalculates the future position based on the updated direction. The direction vector's length is normalized and scaled by the step size to ensure consistent movement speed.
- **Pheromone Influence**: If ants find food, their moving behaviour changes. Ants adjust their path based on pheromone concentrations, favoring directions with higher pheromone levels. When pheromone influence is factored in, the method integrates the pheromone direction into the object's movement direction if pheromone_direction is provided. This pheromone direction is scaled by self.pheromone_influence to adjust its impact on the overall direction. The object's direction is then the sum of the rotated direction and the scaled pheromone direction. This combined direction is normalized and scaled by the step size, ensuring the movement is influenced by both the object's own direction and the pheromone trail, guiding the object more effectively towards or away from certain areas based on the pheromone signals within its search radius.
- **Food Detection and Collection**: An ant has a pheromone status which is changed upon dropping and collecting food. This status affects the ant's behavior, influencing its movement and interaction with other ants and the environment. Upon locating food, the ant evaluates its proximity to the food source. It assesses whether it is within a specified radius of the food source, indicating that it is close enough to collect the food. Before attempting to pick up food, the ant checks its current pheromone status. If the ant is in the searching state, indicating that it is not currently carrying any food, it proceeds to the next step. The ant verifies that there is still food available at the source. It checks the amount of food remaining at the food source to ensure that it can collect a sufficient quantity. If all conditions are met — being close to the food source, having a searching pheromone status and food being available — the ant decides to pick up the food. It collects as much food as it can carry, up to its maximum carrying capacity. After successfully picking up the food, the ant switches its pheromone status to indicate that it is now returning to the colony with food. This change in status triggers a shift in behavior, directing the ant to follow a path back to the colony while leaving a pheromone trail behind. The pheromone trail marks the path to the food source. This pheromone trail serves as a guide for other ants, leading them to the discovered food source. Upon reaching the colony, the ant assesses its proximity to the colony location. If it is within a specified radius of the colony, the ant decides to drop off the food, which means that the ant's pheromone status is changed back. This action contributes to the colony's food reserves and completes the foraging cycle for that ant.


## Pheromone Management

Pheromones are crucial for indirect communication between ants. They leave pheromone trails to guide other ants to food sources and back to the colony.

### Key Processes:

- **Pheromone Deposition**: The pheromone class initializes an pheromone array, which is a multi-dimensional NumPy array representing the simulated environment's grid. In the simulation, the coordination between the ants movements and the distribution of pheromones is achieved through the mapping of ant coordinates to a pheromone grid. Each cell in the grid corresponds to a specific position within the environment, and initially, all pheromone levels are set to zero. Upon movement, ants deposit pheromones along their path by updating the corresponding positions in the array. This process is facilitated by the leave_pheromone() method, which takes the ant's current position and the pheromone status as input parameters. The pheromone status determines the type of pheromone being deposited (e.g., from food sources or back to the colony), allowing for the differentiation of pheromone trails based on their purpose.
- **Pheromone Evaporation**: The evaporation is simulated by gradually reducing the pheromone levels in all cells of the grid over time. By applying a reduction factor to the existing pheromone levels, the simulation mimics the natural degradation of pheromone trails due to environmental factors. Moreover a threshold criterion is established to determine the minimum pheromone level required for a cell to maintain its non-zero status.
- **Trail Following**: Ants sense and follow pheromone trails to find food sources or return to the colony.
As ants navigate the environment, they rely on the pheromone levels stored in the grid to guide their movements effectively. By querying the pheromone grid at their current position, ants can determine the intensity of pheromones in their vicinity. This information influences their decision-making process, allowing them to adjust their movement direction based on the concentration of pheromones detected. By following paths with higher pheromone levels, ants can efficiently locate food sources or return to the colony. When an ant encounters an obstacle on its path, its position is readjusted to navigate around the obstacle.

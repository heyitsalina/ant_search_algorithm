        Manages pheromone information in a tensor within a simulated environment.
        The tensor represents the pheromone strength at different positions within the simulation area.

        Args:
            grid_shape (Tuple[int, int]): A tuple representing the height and width of the simulated environment.

        Attributes:
            pheromones (numpy.ndarray): A 3D numpy array of dimensions (Depth, Height, Width), storing the pheromone strength at each visited position(int).
                                        The depth represents different pheromone matrices ('coming from colony' = -1 | 'coming from food' = 1).

        Methods:
            leave_pheromone():
                Leaves a pheromone from each ant at every movement, adding it to the corresponding location in the tensor.

            get_pheromone_level():
                Determines the pheromone level at a specific location in the tensor.

            reduce_pheromone(reducing_factor: float, timeframe: float):
                Reduces the pheromone strength in the tensor after each epoch.

        Leaves pheromone at a given position based on the pheromone status. This method is typically
        called when an ant moves, to mark its trail with pheromones.

            pos (Tuple[int, int]): The (x, y) coordinates in the grid where the pheromone is to be placed.
            pheromone_status (int): The status of the pheromone to be left, which determines the depth
